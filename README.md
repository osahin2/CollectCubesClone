# Collect Cubes Clone
Collect Cubes Clone Game is created for my personal development and understand more things about mobile games. I tried to use Pointer Event Data for mobile inputs.I also learned 
about Action Events. Tried to understand event driven programming. There is a problem about inputs, we cant do good circular drag and we are not manipulating our first position 
when we click on the screen and move finger far away. This may be a problem cause i have to go back my first position for turn my player, this is not good for gameplay. Like i 
said before we can change our first position when our finger goes away or we can use a joystick which is dynamic one.
